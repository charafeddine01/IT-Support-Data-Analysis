Step 1: Define Key Metrics
We need to determine the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will drive decisions. Here are some examples:

Ticket Volume Analysis:

Total number of tickets per department
Tickets per time period (daily, weekly, monthly)
Peak times for tickets to optimize staffing
Resolution Times:

Average resolution time per issue type
Compare resolution times by priority level (high, medium, low)
Performance of individual technicians (e.g., who resolves tickets the fastest)
Issue Type Frequency:

Most common issues reported (e.g., network problems, software errors)
Percentage breakdown of each issue type
SLA (Service Level Agreement) Compliance:

Percentage of tickets resolved within the SLA (e.g., 24-hour resolution for high-priority tickets)
Identify bottlenecks causing SLA breaches
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT):

Analysis of user feedback (if available) to identify satisfaction trends
Use sentiment analysis (optional, using Python) to interpret feedback from user comments
Step 2: Collect and Prepare Data
You’ll need a dataset to work with. If you don’t have access to real organizational data, you can:

Generate Mock Data:
Create a dataset in Excel with columns like:
Ticket ID, Issue Type, Priority, Department, Technician, Created Date, Resolved Date, SLA, CSAT (1-5)
Fields Example:
Ticket_ID | Issue_Type | Priority | Created_Date | Resolved_Date | Technician | Department | CSAT
1000 rows (you can automate the creation using random functions in Excel)
Step 3: Analyze Data with SQL and Excel
Once you have the dataset, you can move forward with analysis using SQL for querying and Excel for visualization.
